# logging-Decorator
This was an assigment that was part of python concepts and methodology I, taken in fall 2020. The assignment was as follows:

Goals:

Create a working call log decorator with a test function.
Log, the time, the function name and the arguments/kwarguments to a file.
Adhere to PEP8
Bonus:

Log call count and duration of task.
Nice formatting!
I'd suggest that you use 'with' syntax.
error handling with file not found and similar.
add this to a decorators module for yourself
ensure that it works with imported functions
ensure that it works with recursive imported functions
utilize docstrings for the decorator and test functions
ensure that the decorators preserve arguments and returns


The time calculator function is an example function, it can work with any function I pass to it.
